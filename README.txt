Adds a shortcode to Ultimate Member that creates a button for a status update modal like Twitter.

== Description ==

If you would like users to update their Ultimate Member Social Activity status like Twitter, then this plugin is for you.  Simply add the shortcode to a widget or menu item that supports them and it creates a button.  This button will open up a modal with the status update interface.  Your members will be able to post from any page you like now. 

Requires the Ultimate Member Plugin and the Ultimate Member extension "Social Activity".  Find them here:  http://www.ultimatemember.com

If you would like to use this in a widget, I'd suggest the plugin "Enhanced Text Widget".  Install and activate that and place your shortcode in the widget!

<b>Shortcode Example</b>
<blockquote>
[post_wall_modal label=“Status Update”]
